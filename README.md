### Work without any external modules

If you are going to start a project, you need a program for document management function, chat function to communicate with team members, and issue management function in addition to the code editor. However, if you use PICode, you can use all of the above functions on just a single web page.

-   code edit function

### Possible collaboration

Through PICode real-time communication, you can see in real time where your team members are working, what they are working on. Therefore, you can work on documents or codes with them, or you can discuss the team's work by chatting in real time.
